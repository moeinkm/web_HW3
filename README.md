## CRUD

First of all install node.js which probably you did in order to use ```npm``` and node.js as backend project language.

## Backend

To install dependencies do the following

```
> cd backend
> npm install
```

to start server:

```
> nodemon server.js
```

## Frontend

Just like backend
```
> cd frontend/directory/to/install/dependencies
> npm install
```
To start in localhost:
```
> npm start
```

to build it:

```
> npm run build
```
